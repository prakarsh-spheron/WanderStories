# WanderStories

Welcome to WanderStories
This project aims to create a website that simplifies and enhances the travel experiences for users. The website will feature a wide range of destinations, hotels, restaurants, and activities, as well as travel tips and advice. The goal is to make it easy for users to plan and book their next trip.
WanderStories aims to develop a web application that simplifies the travel experience for users by providing a web3.0 platform for them to read and share travel blogs. The application will allow users to search for travel destinations, read blogs about those destinations, and share their own experiences through their own blog posts. Additionally, the application will include features such as the connection to wallet via metamask that allows users to access the website, ability to save and organize favorite blog posts, like and rate blog posts, and receive personalized travel recommendations based on their reading history and preferences. The blogs act as NFTs! themselves. The goal is to create a one-stop-shop for all travel-related information and inspiration, making it easier for users to plan and enjoy their next trip.
